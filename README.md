# Stock-Analysis
# Overview of Project
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to reiterate through different stocks that may be worth investing in in year 2018. Dependng on the yearly return of each stock, one will be able to determine if they should invest in a particular stock or not. Microsoft Excel VBA programming was used to efficiently populate this information in a timely and accurate manner. 
# Results

After running the code, the return for all stocks in 2018 rain in a little over 7 seconds. This is great because it demonstrates how effective and efficient it is to use coding within the VBA developer to analyze large data to find exactly what one is looking for, in this case, the yearly return for 12 different stocks.

After running the code, we can see that for year 2018, the best stock to have invested in was ENPH and RUN. Both resulted in a positive return a the en of the year. 
# Summary
A great advantage in refactoring code is that we can break down the data to only use and view the information we are looking for. The system will run as long as everything is coded correctly, and if it isn't, it will tell you exactly where the error is being caused. It will save tons of time in analysising our data and because it auto-analyzes, the chance of making an error is less likely.
